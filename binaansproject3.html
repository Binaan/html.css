           Hardware. The PlayStation 5 is powered by a custom system on a chip (SoC) designed in tandem by AMD and Sony, integrating a custom 7nm AMD Zen 2 CPU with eight cores running at a variable frequency capped at 3.5 GHz. The integrated GPU is also a custom unit based on AMD's RDNA 2 graphics architecture 
            he retailer recently updated its PS5 pre-order page to read: "Release date 05/02/2021". We've also spotted that Currys has the PS5 Pulse 3D Wireless PS5 headset back in stock (it could be worth grabbing one while you can). 
            “PS5 is compatible with 8K displays at launch, and after a future system software update will be able to output resolutions up to 8K when content is available, with supported software,” Sony says. For now, the PS5 will only be able to render video output at 720p, 1080i, 1080p, and 4K 2160p resolutions. PS4 titles get even better on PS5. Select PS4 titles will see increased loading speeds on the PS5 console, and will also leverage Game Boost, offering improved or more stable frame rates. Some titles with unlocked frame rates or dynamic resolution up to 4K may see higher fidelity.A large portion of PS5 consoles are made in China and transported globally via sea. It can take months for these units to be shipped from China to various parts of the Globe.
